     description: This is a place to store any working drafts that will eventually grow up to become full fledged GOUP articles/courses. It's meant more for single pieces of content, if you want to create a draft of a course then create a separate folder for it!

## Let's Get To Work!

This is a special folder for holding any drafts that are currently in progress on GOUP. In this section you'll mostly find
articles or documents that will be one-offs of existing courses.
